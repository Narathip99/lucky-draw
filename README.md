# Lucky Draw Application

## Overview

This is a web-based lucky draw application that allows users to participate in a lucky draw by clicking a button. The prizes are awarded based on predetermined categories, with some prizes having limited availability.

## Prizes Structure

1. **First Prize:** Apple Watch - 1 Winner
2. **Second Prize:** Vacuum Cleaner - 2 Winners
3. **Third Prize:** Cash Prize - Unlimited Winners

Each user is allowed to click the "Draw" button once to determine their prize. Once the prize is awarded, it is no longer available for others (except for the unlimited third prize).

## Features

- **Draw Button:** A single-click button that initiates the draw.
- **Prize Allocation:** Ensures that only 1 first prize and 2 second prizes are given out, while unlimited third prizes are available.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays the result of the draw to the user immediately after clicking.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (for the UI), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (for typing), and [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) (for rendering the draw wheel).

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the application locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16.0.0) and npm (>=7.0.0) should be installed.

### Instructions

   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   npm start

4. **Open the Application in Browser:**

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized bundle of the application in the `/build` directory.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any web server, including static hosts like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can click the "Draw" button to participate in the lucky draw. The result will be displayed immediately, and the application will ensure that the limited prizes are correctly distributed among participants.

## Code Quality
